Symbiot is an open-source service which helps making _things_ communicate to each other. Think about a _thing_ as any connected physical or virtual entity. Your toaster has Webhooks? Then it's a _thing_. Your dildo exposes a RESTful API? Then it's a _thing_. Your Facebook wall is a _thing_. At large, anything reachable programmatically from the machine where Symbiot is running is a _thing_. And anything that can reach the machine where Symbiot is running is a _thing_ too. Needless to say, _things_ are plenty.

Now imagine a world where, without writing a single line of code, you can flash a red light in your living room when there is no more beer in the fridge. Maybe you fall into the category of people who believe that the usage of the aforementioned dildo should send syslog messages to a remote server? What if your alarm clock was telling your coffee machine to warm up while you are still trying to make sense of your psycho dreams? That would be great, and that's what Symbiot is trying to make real.

Ever tried [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) or [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com)? If not, you should, these services are great. But as great as they are, they are not completely free, they are not open-source and they don't run in the comfort of your own private network. Symbiot is free, is open-source and it runs on your machine in the blink of an eye.
